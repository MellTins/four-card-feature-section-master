## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a relatively "easy" challenge, I did have some difficulties positioning the cards in the middle, and then the site kept breaking, but overall I'm happy to have achieved a very similar result.

```css
 #orange {
    grid-row: 2;
    grid-column: 2;
  }
  #green,
  #blue {
    grid-row: span 2;
  }
```
### Continued development

I still have a lot to delve into on the grid, but overall it was a lot of fun to learn the basics of it.

### Useful resources

- [Sujeito Programador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aql4FvOKcho&ab_channel=Sujeitoprogramador) - This video helped me to practically understand the rows and columns and how I can position them responsively.. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
